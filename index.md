## About MEME and SEEDS

The Modeling and Evidence Mapping Environment (MEME) was developed to help users build qualitative models of scientific phenomena, and revise those models based on evidence.

We have been exploring students' use of MEME as part of the Scaffolding Explanations and Epistemic Development for Systems (SEEDS) research project. 

Here is a screen capture of the MEME interface:
