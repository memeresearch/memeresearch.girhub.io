## MEME Resources

MEME is open source! If you want to contribute or download and run the code, it is available here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/inq-seeds/boilerplate" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/inq-seeds/boilerplate</a> (requires a Gitlab account, and some comfort with node / npm to run).

**Coming soon**: downloadable version of the app.

### MEME Curriculum Materials
**Coming soon**: sample curriculum materials for the eutrophication unit we developed using MEME.

### Sample Models
**Coming soon**: sample models created by students to show MEME in action.
