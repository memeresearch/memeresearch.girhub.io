## MEME Resources

### MEME
MEME is open source! If you want to contribute or download and run the code, it is available here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/inq-seeds/boilerplate" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/inq-seeds/boilerplate</a> (requires a Gitlab account, and some comfort with node / npm to run).

If you want to test meme, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/memeresearch/memeresearch.github.io/blob/main/assets/meme/memedemo.zip?raw=true" target="_blank">mac meme demo</a>. Note that you will need to create you own classes, groups, and resources. A demo with sample data will be coming soon.

### MEME Curriculum Materials
**Coming soon**: sample curriculum materials for the eutrophication unit we developed using MEME.

### Sample Models
**Coming soon**: sample models created by students to show MEME in action.
