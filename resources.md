## MEME Resources

### MEME
MEME is open source! If you want to contribute or download and run the code, it is available here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/inq-seeds/boilerplate" target="_blank">https://gitlab.com/inq-seeds/boilerplate</a> (requires a Gitlab account, and some comfort with node / npm to run).

**Demo MEME online**: We have setup a test classroom, based on our current implementation here: http://167.172.147.247:3000/#/. You can access this as one of two demo students using either of the following login tokens: KOALA-GM3FD or PANDA-R93I5. These represent students in two different groups who can see each other's models. Feel free to edit the model and add comments to try out the features! 

**Coming soon**: a downloadable macintosh version of the software. If you would like to access this now, contact <a href="mailto:jdanish@indiana.edu?subject=MEME">jdanish@indiana.edu</a>.

### MEME Curriculum Materials
**Coming soon**: sample curriculum materials for the eutrophication unit we developed using MEME.

### Sample Models
